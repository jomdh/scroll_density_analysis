# Papyrus Unroll Analysis

## Introduction

Welcome to the Papyrus Unroll Analysis, a non-AI technique for the analysis and deciphering of ancient papyrus scrolls.

This is proposal leverages deterministic algorithms to stack 2D TIFF images into a 3D volume, emphasize features such as ink or text, and facilitate further in-depth investigation. The authenticity of the results is preserved by minimizing the risk of 'hallucinations'.

This is the candidate for the context of the Vesuvian Challenge!
